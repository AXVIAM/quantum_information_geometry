## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements the full working model of **Quantum Information Geometry** — also known as **QIR** — a framework that extends General Relativity by introducing a foundational mechanism of curvature based on structural memory and information flow.

Where GR tells us **how** mass curves spacetime,  
QIR explains **why** mass generates curvature in the first place.

> QIR proposes that curvature arises not from mass alone,  
> but from the system’s **memory of transformation**, quantified by the coherence field \( I \).
